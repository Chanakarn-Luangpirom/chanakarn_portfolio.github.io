Hi! I'm currently a graduate student at Cornell University in Operations Research and Information Engineering. Previously I was a senior data analyst at Agoda working in the performance marketing team. Ever since I graduated from my undergraduate university, I've been very active in the field of data analytics. I love to try new things and create personal projects after I'm done with college tasks.

One of the reasons I've created this portfolio website is to keep track of what I've done & share my thoughts with the community. I know the learning road is long but I'm enjoying what I do! Also, during my free time I like to do some baking, cooking, and playing games. Although I've been busy with my graduate studies, I try to contribute as much as I can!
